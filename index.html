    <h1>Chrome Bug Reproduction Page</h1>
    <h2>Requires the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?authuser=2">MetaMask Extension</a> To Work</h2>
    <p style="color:blue;">
      While the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts">content script documentation</a> says that the run_at key should allow an extension's contentscript to run before any page scripts, this page is lightweight enough that its scripts will load before MetaMask has a chance to inject its web3 script.
    </p>

    <p>This bug was formally submitted to Chrome <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=715712#">in this issue</a>.</p>

<script>

  if (typeof web3 === 'undefined') {
    render('web3 was not loaded before the page script ran.')
  } else {
    render('web3 was injected before the page scripts ran! The bug was not reproduced.')
  }

  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    if (typeof web3 === 'undefined') {
      render('wow! web3 was not even loaded after the window load event! This is worse than usual, but not unprecedented!')
    } else {
      render('web3 was injected after the window load event, which is what <a href="https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#partly_sunny-web3---ethereum-browser-environment-check">we now recommend to our users</a>.')
    }
  })

  function render (msg) {
    var p = document.createElement('p')
    var body = document.querySelector('body')
    p.innerHTML = msg
    body.appendChild(p)
